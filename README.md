# AirBnB Clone Project

## Project Overview
This is a clone of the AirBnB web application, developed as part of the ALX Software Engineering program. The project will implement core features of AirBnB including user authentication, property listings, bookings, and reviews.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python (Flask framework)
- **Database**: MySQL (with SQLAlchemy ORM)
- **Infrastructure**: Nginx web server, Ubuntu
- **Deployment**: AWS (optional)

## Project Goals
1. Implement a console application to manage AirBnB objects
2. Develop a RESTful API for the application
3. Build a dynamic web interface
4. Add user authentication and authorization
5. Implement database storage

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Set up virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the console: `./console.py`

## Technology Stack

This project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used for building the backend RESTful APIs and handling server-side logic.
  
- **Django REST Framework**: A powerful toolkit built on top of Django for creating Web APIs, used to implement the REST API endpoints.

- **PostgreSQL**: A relational database system used for persistent data storage, offering scalability and reliability for user and property data.

- **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, implemented to provide flexible data retrieval options alongside REST endpoints.

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used to create the interactive frontend components of the application.

- **Next.js**: A React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation, used to improve performance and SEO.

- **Docker**: A platform for containerization, used to package the application and its dependencies into containers for consistent deployment across environments.

- **AWS (Amazon Web Services)**: Cloud services used for hosting the application, storing media files, and other infrastructure needs.

- **Redis**: An in-memory data store used for caching and improving application performance.

- **Celery**: A distributed task queue system used for handling asynchronous tasks like email notifications and background processes.
